* What is this?

The main purpose of this file is to enable winner-mode. By default
winner-mode is included in emacs since version 20 however it is not
enabled.

This is an experiment in making packages that enable micro features.
An idea I have had for somet time that I am finally testing out.

* Install
This package is on marmalade. Install it from marmalade
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
package-install enable-marmalade
#+END_SRC
